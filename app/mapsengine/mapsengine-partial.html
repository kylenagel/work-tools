				<td>What it does:</td>
				<td>Google's Maps Engine interface allows the creation of quick and easy maps with markers, lines, shapes or routes. Google Fusion Tables is preferred for larger sets of addresses or more complex information windows, and Google Maps Engine allows for additions of markers without spreadsheets and easier drawing of lines, shapes and routes.</td>

	<h2>How to make one</h2>
	
	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>1. Before starting, confirm or set up a Google account</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is important because, not only are Google accounts very useful for creating and storing all kinds of Google products and information, but also because Google Fusion Tables files are automatically saved to your drive.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">drive.google.com</a>.</li>
			<li>If you already have a Google account (a gmail address), sign in. If not, create one. It's free and easy. Just follow the instructions.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>2. Open a new map and give it a name</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>On opening the Maps Engine site, click "Create a new map."</li>
			<li>To help you stay organized, name your map. Click on the words "Untitled map" in the legend on the left and give the map a title and description. These will show to the user if the map is embedded on our sites.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>3. Manage your layers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Each layer of the map can be shown or hidden independently by a user and can contain any mix of markers, lines or shapes. So, plan your layers by thinking about which markers, lines or shapes should be grouped together (only one layer might be necessary).</li>
			<li>Add a layer by clicking "Add layer" at the top of the legend.</li>
			<li>Name the layer by clicking on "Untitled layer."</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>4. Draw on the map</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Choose the layer in which you want this map feature to appear by clicking on it in the legend. The active layer will be highlighted by a blue bar to its left. Routes will automatically be created as separate layers.</li>
			<li>To set markers:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Click on the marker box (with the teardrop icon) in the tools menu.</li>
				<li>Find your location. You can use the search bar to find a location, or zoom in on the map to find where you would like the marker to go.</li>
				<li>Click on the map where you would like the marker to appear.</li>
				<li>Give your marker a name and a description. The marker's name will identify it in the legend on the left, which will also display to users if the map is embedded on our websites. If you click away before giving the marker a name and description, you can edit it later by clicking on the line and then on the "Edit" icon (looks like a pen) in the information window.</li>
				<li>If applicable, add a photo or video to the informatiton window by clicking the camera icon and either doing a Google search with the options provided or pasting a photo of YouTube video URL path.</li>

				<li>Click on any other points on the map where you want the line to change direction.</li>
				<li>After clicking on the last location, click on the end of the line to complete it.</li>
				<li>Give your line a name and description. The name will identify it in the legend on the left, and the name and description will show to users.

				<li>Give your shape a name and description. The name will identify it in the legend on the left, and the name and description will show to users. If you click away before giving the shape a name and description, you can edit it later by clicking on the shape and then on the "Edit" icon (looks like a pen) in the information window.</li>
