	<h2>How to make one</h2>
	
	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>1. Before starting, confirm or set up a Google account</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is important because, not only are Google accounts very useful for creating and storing all kinds of Google products and information, but also because a Google Spreadsheet is needed to create the timeline.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">drive.google.com</a>.</li>
			<li>If you already have a Google account (a gmail address), sign in. If not, create one. It's free and easy. Just follow the instructions.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>2. Create a blank Google Spreadsheet</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Open your drive, <a href="https://drive.google.com/">drive.google.com</a>.</li>
			<li>Click the red "CREATE" button on the left and then "Spreadsheet."</li>
			<li>Rename the spreadsheet to something that will be easy to find later. File > Rename.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>3. Create two tabs in your spreadsheet</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>At the bottom of the spreadsheet, click the "+" sign to the left of the tab titled "Sheet1" to create a second tab</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>4. Set up the column names in each tab</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>First tab</strong> (questions and options)</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Question</li>
				<li>A column for each option, named "Option1," "Option2" and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Second tab</strong> (results)</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Result (name of the result)</li>
				<li>Explanation</li>
				<li>Facebook Explanation</li>
				<li>Image (url for an image matching the result)</li>
				<li>Caption</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section_step">
		<h3>5. Enter your content in each tab</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>First tab</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Question: the text of the question</li>
				<li>
					Option columns: the option the user sees with the result(s) between curly brackets.
					<br>
					<strong>Text or image: </strong> You can input either text or image URLs for the options. If it's an image URL, the user will see an image for the options (URL must end in .jpg or .png). If it's text, the user will see the text.
					<br>
					<strong>Multiple results tied to one option: </strong>One option can connect to multiple results by separating those results with ";" and no space in between.
					<br>
					<strong>Example (text option): </strong>"Cookie Monster {Dayton Art Institute}" in a cell will show the user an option of "Cookie Monster" for that question. If the user chooses Cookie Monster, it will add 1 to the total for result "Dayton Art Institue."
					<br>
					<strong>Example (image option): </strong>"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/04/02/8f/d2/040515-ham-main-street4.jpg {Bacon Fest}" in a cell will show the user the image from that URL as an option for that question. If the user chooses that image, it will add 1 to the total for the result "Bacon Fest."
					<br>
					<strong>Example (multiple results with an option): </strong>"Ice Ice Baby {Century Bar;Blind Bob's}" in a cell will show the user an option of "Ice Ice Baby" for that question. If the user chooses Ice Ice Baby, it will add 1 to the total for both results "Century Bar" and "Blind Bob's"
					<br>
					<strong>Important: </strong> The text for the matching result inside the curly brackets must <strong>exactly match</strong> the result text in the first column of the second tab. Otherwise, the quiz won't find a matching result whose total to add to.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Second tab</strong></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Result: The name of the result. The user will later see the text after "You got ..." This text must also exactly match what's inside the curly brackets in the options fields.</li>
				<li>Explanation: The explanation of the result that shows to users when they complete the quiz.</li>
				<li>Facebook Explanation: The explanation of the result that shows on Facebook when users share their result (might need to be shorter or different than what is shown to users when they receive their result).</li>
				<li>Image: The image the user will see along with the result</li>
				<li>Caption: Caption to show below the result image</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
